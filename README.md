# PartyApp
<p>
This is an old Android app that I want to play around with. 
It uses google maps, the google places api, and json to find clubs around the area. 
Works but not well documented and needs lots of improvement. To get this project running you are going to need a Google Maps API key and a Google Server API key, listing those keys in the string file located under the res folder.
